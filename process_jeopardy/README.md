# CSEP Jeopardy

This work is derived from JavaScript Jeopardy by Anthony Hessler. See https://github.com/hessler/js-jeopardy/ 

A simple and customizable JavaScript-based Jeopardy game. Please note that this is **_not_** any sort of multi-player game, nor does it have any sort of logic for keeping track of points/money. Rather, it is a simple display of a Jeopardy game with an intro screen, a Jeopardy board with categories/questions, and an end-of-game screen.
